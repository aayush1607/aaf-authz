# Testing Model
# We are making a Testing model based loosely on George Orwell's Animal Farm
# In Animal Farm, Animals did all the work but didn't get any priviledges.
#   In our test, the animals can't see anything but their own role, etc
# Dogs were supervisors, and ostensibly did something, though mostly laid around
#   In our test, they have Implicit Permissions by being Admins
# Pigs were the Elite.  They did nothing, but watch everyone and eat the produce
#   In our test, they have Explicit Permissions to see everything they want
