========================================
Automated Configuration and Certificates
========================================

*Note: this document assumes UNIX Bash Shell.  Being Java, AAF works in Windows, but you will have to create your own script/instruction conversions.*

=================
Optimal Strategy
=================

ONAP is deployed in Docker Containers or Kubernetes managed Docker Containers.  Therefore, this instruction utilizes a Docker Container as a standalone Utility... (This means that this container will stop as soon as it is done with its work... it is not a long running daemon)

Given that all ONAP entities are also in Docker Containers, they all can access Persistent Volumes.

This tool creates all the Configurations, including Certificates, onto a declared Volume on the directories starting with "/opt/app/osaaf"

==================
Prerequisites
==================
  * Access to a RUNNING AAF System

    * For ONAP TEST, this means

      * Windriver VPN
      * include "10.12.6.214 aaf-onap-test.osaaf.org" in your /etc/hosts or DNS
  * For Writing to Volumes for Docker or K8s

    * Docker

      * Note: it does NOT have to be the SAME Docker that AAF is deployed on...

         * but it DOES have be accessible to the AAF Instance.  

  * For creating Configurations on Local Disk

    * For Development purposes
    * For running AAF on Bare Metal (or VM)
    * A Truststore that includes your CA

      * for ONAP TEST, you can obtain truststoreONAPall.jks from the `AAF FileServer`_.

        * (You can also get the ONAP TEST Root CA there)

    * the latest aaf-auth-cmd-<VERSION>-full.jar from `ONAP Nexus`_.
    * you can still use the same "agent.sh" script below

.. _AAF FileServer: http://aaf-onap-test.osaaf.org/-
.. _ONAP Nexus: https://nexus.onap.org/#nexus-search;quick~aaf-auth-cmd

-----------------------
Obtain the Agent Script
-----------------------
Choose the directory you wish to start in... 

If you don't want to clone all of AAF, just get the "agent.sh" from a Browser:

  https://gerrit.onap.org/r/gitweb?p=aaf/authz.git;a=blob_plain;f=auth/docker/agent.sh;hb=HEAD
  
  rename file "auth-docker-agent.sh" to "agent.sh" (named because of subdirectory in which it is found) 

Note: curl/wget returns an  html, instead of text.  This cannot be used!
  | You have to mv, and rename it to "agent.sh", but avoids full clone...

=============
Run Script
=============
----------------
For Docker/K8s
----------------
In your chosen directory ::
 
  $ bash agent.sh

The Agent will look for "aaf.props", and if it doesn't exist, or is missing information, it will ask for it.

This file is available to reuse for multiple calls. More importantly, you should use it as a template for auto-configuration.  (In ONAP, these are HEAT templates and OOM Helm Charts)

--------------------------
For Local/BareMetal (VM)
--------------------------
In your chosen directory ::
 
  $ bash agent.sh local <instructions>

The Agent will look for "aaf.props", and if it doesn't exist, or is missing information, it will ask for it.

=======================
'aaf.prop' Properties
=======================

These properties will be created when you run "agent.sh".  Many of the values will be defaulted, or allow you to change.  It will be placed into an "aaf.props" file for you to save, edit or otherwise modify/utilize.

==================== ================= ============
Query                Tag               Description
==================== ================= ============
DOCKER REPOSITORY    DOCKER_REPOSITORY Defaults to current ONAP Repository
CADI Version         VERSION           Defaults to current CADI (AAF) version
AAF's FQDN           AAF_FQDN          PUBLIC Name for AAF. For ONAP Test, it is 'aaf-onap-test.osaaf.org'
AAF FQDN IP          AAF_FQDN_IP       If FQDN isn't actually found with DNS, you will have to enter the IP.  For 'aaf-onap-test.osaaf.org', it is '10.12.6.214'
Deployer's FQI       DEPLOY_FQI        In a REAL system, this would be a person or process. For ONAP Testing, the id is 'deployer@people.osaaf.org'
Deployer's PASSWORD  DEPLOY_PASSWORD   OPTIONAL!! REAL systems should not store passwords in clear text. For ONAP Testing, the password is 'demo123456!'
App's Root FQDN      APP_FQDN          This will show up in the Cert Subject, make it the App Acronym. i.e 'clamp'
App's FQI            APP_FQI           Fully Qualified ID given by Organization and with AAF NS/domain.  ex: 'clamp@clamp.onap.org'
App's Volume         VOLUME            Volume to put the data, see above. ex: 'clamp_config'
DRIVER               DRIVER            Docker Volume type... See Docker Volume documentation. Default is 'local'
LATITUDE of Node     LATITUDE          Global latitude coordinate of Node (best guess in Kubernetes)
LONGITUDE of Node    LONGITUDE         Global longitude coordinate of Node (best guess in Kubernetes)
HOSTNAME             HOSTNAME          Defaults to SYSTEM provided "hostname". Use when System doesn't report what is actually needed, such as vanity urls, multi-NIC cards, short names, i.e. htydb77 reported instead of htydb77.some.company.org, etc.
Docker User          DUSER             User needed inside the Docker Container.  Without, this will be root
Container NS         CONTAINER_NS      The Namespace for the container.  Provided for Multi-NS support, this would be "onap" for Test OOM, etc.

*Note 1: FQDNs are set in AAF's Credential Artifact data, accessible in "Cred Details" from Namespace Page*

*Note 2: Also, AAF itself is different, as it is not an ONAP only component... It is also expected to be used outside of ONAP.*

If something goes wrong, and Certificate is not created, you can adjust the data, remove the data from the Container's /opt/app/osaaf/local dir, and it will generate again. ::

  root@77777:/opt/app/osaaf/local# rm *
  root@77777:/opt/app/osaaf/local# exit
  $ bash agent.sh bash

===============
Informational
===============

There are two sets of Credentials at play here.  The ability to create the Certificate belongs to one of
  
  * The person responsible for the ID in the Organization 
  * A delegated deployer

It is expected in large organizations that Individual Employees are given the responsibility of an ID for an APP they are responsible for.

  In ONAP test, to simplify create/tear-down environment... 
     | The **Owner** is always "mmanager@people.osaaf.org". 
     | The **Sponsor** is always "aaf_admin@people.osaaf.org".

In a large org, there are probably many Operations teams to support many different apps.

  In ONAP test, 
     The **Deployer** is always set to "deployer@people.osaaf.org" for all Apps.
